    At SiteMe.in we believe everyone has a right to have their own website. Not everyone may have the funds to pay exorbitant
    amounts to web agencies to develop simple sites for them. Don't get us wrong, there are really awesome agencies out
    there that do great work, but for a lot of people that may be overkill. If you want a blog, one pager, simple brochure
    site you can use our site generator and have a site ready at a fraction of the cost.

    Websites do cost money, right from
    purchasing the domain name, renting a hosting server to paying developers/designers for their time. We have automated and streamlined
    most of the process, drastically reducing time and costs for everyone. Most of our work costs anywhere from $1 to $100. For more customized
    solutions, we won't charge you more than $500.

<p class="lead">
    A lot of our work is possible because we have very a talented and widely experienced team who devote some time off their schedule to
    provide this service. But most importantly, we have a big heart and love what we do.
